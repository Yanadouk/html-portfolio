<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Yana, I started my path as a UX designer in the academic studies of psychology. Ever since high school, I knew that I want to understand a person's motivation, feelings, and thoughts.</p>

<p>When I started looking into the studies at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Academic College, I saw that they had different specializations combined with psychology; one was UX design. The word design attracted me.</p>

<p>At my core, I'm an artist. I have always been very creative and interested in the world of design. Today I do abstract art. When I started researching the field of UX design I discovered a world that combines my two interests: Design and helping people have a better experience.</p>
